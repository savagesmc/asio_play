# asio_play

My personal sandbox for experimenting with the [boost::asio](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html)
library as well as c++ support for asynchronous processing.

Examples taken from:
* [A guide to getting started with boost::asio](https://www.gamedev.net/blog/950/entry-2249317-a-guide-to-getting-started-with-boostasio/)
* [Boost's c++11 examples](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/doc/html/boost_asio/examples/cpp11_examples.html)
